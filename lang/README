If you want to help with translations please:


- Make a copy of the English language file (en.php) and save it
  as xx.php, where xx is the language code, e.g. la.php for Latin.

  Refer to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes
  for a list of valid language codes.

- Translate the text strings using natural spelling, e.g. äöüß

- Save the file with UTF-8 encoding, without BOM!

- Send your translation for review to phhpro@gmail.com


When your translation is accepted and you are the lead or sole
author, your name will appear in the @author token. Else, it
will go into an additional @coauthor token.
